# Pytorch_basics_AI_Udacity_scholarship (Lesson 5)
  ***Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch***  (one can find the Udacity official repository [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch))

* Here I will post a couple of notebooks which contain the basics covered within the lessons from Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch course (this is the way I felt that I should understand, add details). 

* Of course, this repository will be updated with the time, as I review and discover other essential things to explain to myself more clear :) .
